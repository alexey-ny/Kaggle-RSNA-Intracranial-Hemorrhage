# Kaggle-RSNA-Intracranial-Hemorrhage
Submission to Kaggle competition RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage 2019

This is my project for RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection competition hosted on Kaggle in 2019.

There were a lot of great notebooks exploring the data and providing great ideas for the baseline models. 
I used a lot of code from this <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/akensert/inceptionv3-prev-resnet50-keras-baseline-model'>notebook</a> by <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/akensert'> akensert </a>.
And most of ideas and moethods for cleaning were taken from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward'>Jeremy Howard</a> series of notebooks on FastAI implementation for this competition.
